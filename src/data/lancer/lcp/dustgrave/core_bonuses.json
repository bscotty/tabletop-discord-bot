    "effect": "If your mech has fewer than three mounts (excluding integrated mounts), it gains an additional Superheavy Mount. A Superheavy Mount can only take Superheavy Weapons. Weapons installed in this Mount still need Bracing, and must use a Heavy Mount for Bracing if possible.",
    "description": "You'd be surprised how large a gun you can fit in a frame if you rip out peripheral systems and failsafe redundancies."
