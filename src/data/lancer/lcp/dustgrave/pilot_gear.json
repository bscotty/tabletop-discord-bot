Madrigal weapons and GEAR may only be equipped by pilots wearing the MADRIGAL BOARDING CARAPACE. While wearing the carapace, you may only DISMOUNT or EJECT before your mech has acted for the turn (excluding protocols). If you aren't in your mech and it is being controlled by another person or an AI, it may only perform a single quick action and standard movement on each of its turns. It may perform protocols and reactions as normal. When your mech Braces during this time it also loses its remaining Quick Action. These effects lasts until you retake control as a protocol.The MADRIGAL BOARDING CARAPACE counts as one of the two EXOTIC GEAR systems you may have installed at a time, but Madrigal weapons and GEAR do not.",
