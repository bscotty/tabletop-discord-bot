Hell - fire - dark ash and staring back at him was not his eyes, but the eyes of the damned and desolate clasped in the hand of Iku.</p><p>As the waters danced in rhythm, Ololade remained fixated. His thoughts wondering why Lake Empakaai- a place renowned for its untenable beauty, would show him a tragedy so visceral. In his reflection he saw thousands plummet from the gaps in Iku’s hand- falling to the pit of Klunga where they’d only be welcomed by death and soot. A portrayal in contradiction within the soothing and pristine waters stretching out to the extents of Ololade’s vision. Rumor would tell that, when he did come down from the tallest of mountains he would scream the words “I am thinking now!” - “ A victory it gave, glorious and valiant”.</p><p>Years later, a painting would circulate throughout the local ominet, affectionately titled- The Descent to Klunga, it was a masterpiece and also a foreshadowing of something that should have only existed in the delirious mind of a lonely SSC citizen and renowned virtuoso.</p><p>Sometime later- another rumor would surface, one that whispered SSC braved Kalunga, stole Iku’s Hand and painted it in fire’s colors and ashe’s hues. They sought to give it a body and called to any who would listen, the first to answer their call was IPSN. They would offer up a frame, the Blackbeard, in effigy to The Descent to Klunga and from that gift a partnership between SSC and IPSN would birth the Empakaai.</p><p>The Empakaai is primarily distinguished by its cold core reactor powered and oversized independent comp/con controlled sleeve, Iku’s Hand, that features a 50/50 weight distribution with the rest of the frame. The juxtaposition of SSC elegance and IPSN artistic sterility have led many to deem the frame a hideous sight. Though to Ololade- it is a living reflection of what he saw atop the tallest of mountains and through his reflection in Lake Empakaai.</p>",
