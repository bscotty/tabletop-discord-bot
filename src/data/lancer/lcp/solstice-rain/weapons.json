    "description": "<p>The GMS MC-AR assault rifle currently in use throughout Union forces and beyond is a time-tested and reliable design, and so rather than attempting to replace it outright Union CENTCOMM has put out a call for a supplementary standardized battle rifle system which can operate alongside the MC-AR in mixed fireteams, or as a primary weapon system for engaging heavily armored opposition at longer ranges than the MC-TR thermal rifle. The XC-BR uses an advanced caseless electrochemical propellant design capable of firing larger-caliber, armor defeating rounds while minimizing recoil along with an integrated dynamic targeting system, though the weapon is still plagued by intermittent heat issues which can adversely affect performance.</p>",

The Predator nexus benefits from from a comprehensive targeting and autonomy upgrade, incorporating MD+ \"Muse Drive\" smart weapon design. This system's heuristics, though declared Turing-Null, display startlingly advanced target acquisition capabilities even when confronted with active countermeasures that might otherwise confound traditional smart weapon platforms.</p>",
