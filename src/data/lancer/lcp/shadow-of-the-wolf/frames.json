    "description": "<p>Those who examine the House of Remembrance’s push to colonize its holding in the Dawnline Shore often highlight the parallels between Crossland’s extensive rainforests and a mythologised Arrudyen past, as well as the political pressure on the Liberal house from its Republican-leaning elements. Less often examined is the pervasive cultural impact of the industry that has been built – almost from scratch – to support the house’s colonial goals.</p><p>In popular omnivids the Taraxacum has become almost synonymous with the pioneer spirit of the resettlement effort. The image of a heavy mech effortlessly lifting gear, vehicles, industrial equipment, and even prefabricated building components above and into the thick canopies is a symbol of Arrudyen power in distant lands. Moreover, the Taraxacum is a capable military frame prized by Karrakin commanders across the Dawnline Shore both as a mobility multiplier, and for its performance as an AEW and surveillance platform in support of ground operations.</p>",
