    "description": "When you activate this weapon or system, if you meet its Kickstart condition, it gains a burst of energy that makes it easier to use. For systems or weapons, they can be activated or fired as a free action instead of their usual action cost. This does not count as a skirmish or barrage for weapons. If it is a reaction then it can ignore any X/round use restrictions, but it still consumes a reaction for the turn. If the Kickstart condition was the effect of an action you took (ex: ‘you knock a character Prone’), the Kickstart system must be the very next action you take after the triggering action resolves without interruption or the benefit is lost."
