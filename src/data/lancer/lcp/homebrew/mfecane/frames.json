    "description": "<p>The Ibutho is Mfecane’s frontier warrior and symbol of peace. Coming into existence shortly after Mfecane’s establishment as an independent nation-state, the Ibutho has been the face of Mfecane’s dominance in the Maluti Line (formerly known as the Atlas line) since Sec-Com’s defeat in 3280u. Nimble and resilient, the Ibutho’s design is revolutionary and likely the reason for the countless defeats Union and other corpo-states have faced at the tip of its Ilkwa. Blending a lightweight frame fueled by paracausal adjacent technology, when the Ibutho activates SHAKA-----| UNKNOWABLE *ERROR* ZU-LU! ZU-LU! ZU-LU!|……</p><p>Each Ibutho pattern mech and Lancer pilot are configured and trained over their lifetime to accept SHAKA as the embodiment of victory. Consequently, the time necessary to ready an Ibutho and Lancer to accept SHAKA can take half a century and as a result Mfecane is very judicious in their deployment of existing Ibuthos and pilots.</p><p>The Ibutho is a close quarters combat mech, built to employ rapid deadly force and trickery to deceive its foes into believing the battle is won. Employing the use of its Isihlangu and Ilkwa the Ibutho has no equal in rapid application of combat prowess. Known by its reputation of crushing any and every foe indiscriminately the Ibutho is also treasured by Lancer pilots looking to prove themselves in the shadow of SHAKA.</p>",
