    "description": "Mfecaneâ€™s establishment as a nation state and the subsequent defeat of SecComm agents began somewhere around 3280u. Concurrently, Mfecane declared Union's Atlas Line dead, and renamed it the Maluti Line which resembled the Mfecane people's highest peak on Cradle. Mfecane is more a way of life than a discernable corpo-state, with the philosophy of unbuntu (I am because, we are) and quest for conquest at its heart. While most visibly realized in Mfecane mandatory military service, there are the conventional sports, games and recreation present in their Mfecane culture. Heald in equal standing with the Impi War Order's quest for battle  and Mfecane madatory military tradition are the NHP SHAKA the Unkulu and the Umthetho who guide Mfecane's growth. While not too different from the Aun, Mfecane will never let any of the three pillars dominate the others.  <br><br>SHAKA provides guidance and direction the Unkulu shepherds the people and the Impi War Order paves the way for progress, each held accountable to one another in perfect harmony.",
