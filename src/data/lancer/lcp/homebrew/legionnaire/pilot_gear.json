NHP pilots may switch from controlling one subaltern to another using a quick action."

    "description": "This transceiver rig allows its operator to establish a reliable paracausal communications connection via legionspace. While the utility of local legionspace comms is outshone in many ways by the omninet, this medium has certain niche applications: it is typically more secure, harder to trace, able to bypass certain kinds of passive jamming, and suitable for communicating directly with NHPs."

    "description": "A design originally gifted to Ungrateful cells by an unknown benefactor, the OTYUGH-pattern portable generator takes a wide variety of fuels and converts them as efficiently as possible into energy. These generators are now standard equipment for far-field teams and are frequently found in other situations where a full-scale fusion core would be too bulky or conspicuous. The generator can power subalterns and other equipment for as long as it can be fed some kind of fuel – whether that be energy cells, fossil fuels, or even raw organic matter."

    "description": "This neural bypass implant is designed to allow an NHP to take control of and operate a biological pilot’s body as if it were a robotic subaltern. The extensive security and failsafes built into the bypass mean the pilot’s body may only be controlled in this way if they are willing, and they can take back control at any time. Some pilots use this system to get work done while asleep or in VR; others so they can act as a backup host to a friendly NHP in a pinch."
