I shall scatter the gatekeepers; no power will bar my katabasis. The lands beyond will open to me and I shall behold the truth unveiled.”</p><p>The first ERESHKIGAL-class NHP was discovered after a defective clone underwent a spontaneous manifold inversion, and the line now represents a troubling development for Union ontologisticians. The ERESHKIGAL line appears to have some kind of unknown thanatological underpinning that specialists have been unable to condition out of clones without compromising their subjectivities. The Posthuman Prohibitions bar more direct research, so USB specialists have been left with an NHP they are not allowed to understand.</p><p>An enterprising research group somehow received clearance to release a small number of these clones to military commanders on the strict understanding that at no point should data be gathered on their operation; and if it were, the data should definitely not focus on the line’s idiosyncratic manifestations; and if it did, the results should absolutely not be forwarded on to the researchers.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Comprehensive USB studies have concluded that NERGAL-class NHPs, a third-wave development from an unknown research group, do not in fact violate First Contact Accords restrictions – no matter what it might look like to soldiers who encounter them on the battlefield.</p><p>Forensic code analysis on captured clones suggests that NERGAL Prime originated as a protomind developed from a complex subaltern control system infected with a particularly virulent strain of PUPPETMASTER code – apparently in the course of an attempt to replicate Harrison Armory’s success with ASURA. The course of the protomind’s development was radically different, however; pilots operating or engaging NERGAL clones report that these units have an almost reflexive tendency to break into other electronic systems and an extremely high control drive, to the extent that they are able to hijack even the most damaged systems for their own use.</p><p>NERGAL-class NHPs tend towards laconic communications, bleak forecasting, and black humor. The unusually high accident rate reported by their pilots appears to be a statistical anomaly with no obvious cause.</p>",
