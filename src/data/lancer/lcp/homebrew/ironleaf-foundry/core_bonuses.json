    "description": "One of the odder benefits Ironleaf Foundry offers prized supporters are decorative filigree icons that have a disproportionate effect. Opposition attempting to harm the bearers of these icons fall without warning, shattering along stress lines or suffering catastrophic failures of autoloaders. <br>Union Science Bureau has examined these icons and found them to be nothing but metal, without even a source of power. Two competing and equally concerning theories are that these icons are of a mystical nature...or that they are just symbols of being watched over by something much more dangerous."

    "effect": "At the beginning of a scene, after all characters have been set up but before any turn has started you can move your speed. This movement ignores engagement and does not provoke reactions. Once per mission, instead of being set up at the start of a scene you can instead hold yourself in reserves (in the belly of a transport ship, in orbit, buried alive or otherwise off the map). At the start of your first turn, you can place yourself anywhere on the map more than 8 spaces away from a hostile character. Deploying this way consumes your standard move for that turn.",

The winner of this competition is given the rare rights to print the Iron Crown for their mech, a symbol of an untouched champion."
