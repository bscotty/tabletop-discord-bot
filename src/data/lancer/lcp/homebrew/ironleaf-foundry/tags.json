    "description": "This gear reveals its greatest potential when things are at their most tested. If you have one or more Devoted systems or weapons, you gain a Devotion Die, 1d6 starting at 1. Each time you or an allied character marks structure or stress, increase the die by 1, to a maximum of 6. The value of your Devotion Die persists between scenes but resets to 1 when you perform a Full Repair."
