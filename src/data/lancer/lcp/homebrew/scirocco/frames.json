This was done to prevent HA or SSC claiming any of the research for their own but also to take advantage of SAE’s excellent graviton research teams. After the operation was concluded, those research teams were asked to assist in the after-action analysis of NGHI’s data. The deal with SAE was very generous to the design company: SAE personnel would help the USB understand what NGHI had been working on and the USB would give them authorization to limited paracausal developments for their own use in the creation of the SAE Pathfinder; A prototype stealth mech that seemed able to absorb energy without limit.",
