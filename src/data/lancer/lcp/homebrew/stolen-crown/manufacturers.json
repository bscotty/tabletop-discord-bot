    "description": "The planet Sparr is known for the incredible creativity of its inventors and engineers, many of whom are brought together in one workshop at the Volsung Developmental Labs. Largely drawing its talent from Sparri technoshamans trained in the Halls of Ynneval-Returned in Sparr's capital, Ynn, VDL's modus operandi is to combine immense technical skill with a religious, or at least spiritual, approach to the creation of machines.<br><br>Many Sparri believe in the existence of machine spirits, ancestral souls which can be tempted to occupy otherwise mindless machinery with the right prayers and a creative enough frame. Convincing a machine spirit to inhabit a mech frame or other piece of technology is a technoshaman's greatest achievement, and in order to give themselves the best possible chance of success, VDL designers often draw on imagery and legends which would have been familiar to their ancestors.<br><br>VDL usually tests its experimental creations in Sparr before attempting to sell elements of it on to any and all of the Big 4 mech manufacturers.",
