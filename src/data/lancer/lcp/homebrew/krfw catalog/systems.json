Even when the company moved into manufacturing mechs, the Vajra was left on the shelf, not fitting with the design ethos of any of their frames. When the Primor was in early testing phases, however, an engineer found the weapon and installed it, finding it reacted shockingly well with the alloys used in KRFW drones. Retrofitted and rebranded as the “Pinball” Atmospheric Ionizer, it became one of the signature weapons of the floating fortress.",
