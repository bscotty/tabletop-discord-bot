    "description": "The Vidame is one of Karimi, Roux, & Fabjani’s less common licenses, a rare “black-catalog” offering from the company, exclusively made available to pilots with some degree of notoriety or infamy. Like many of KRFW’s frames, the Vidame is designed using blueprints or technology developed by other corporations, in this case based off of the IPS-N Störtebeker. However, unlike the majority of KRFW’s licenses, the Vidame was never intended for dispersal among colonial militias and peacekeeping forces; the frame was, in fact, a personal project of Founding Partner Hanan Karimi, intended for her alone.<br><br>Once more, the base frame would have its core systems ripped out and replaced, the Störtebeker’s TRUESILVER nanites tossed aside in favor of dedicated targeting software and enhanced neural bridges, to further cut down on response delays between pilot thoughts and frame actions. While computational systems and reactor capability suffered in the process, the resultant frame was more than quick and nimble enough for Karimi’s desires.<br><br>According to publicly available logs, the prototype frame was deployed exactly once, though the details of the mission have been stricken from the record. Attempts to reference what fragments have been unencrypted have turned up only dead ends; names of planets that do not exist, star charts that do not match the skies. When interviewed, Karimi denies the test run’s existence at all, seemingly convinced no test run ever happened at all. All the same, the company continues to exclusively offer the frame almost exclusively to those it can plausibly deny any personal connection to…",
