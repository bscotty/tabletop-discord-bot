This mobile logistics hub is instead only available in individual lots, as its onboard e-war suites often identify other Reeves as hostile actors due to the sheer degree of control each one attempts to exert on the battlefield. Due to this, Reeve pilots tend to wind up with reputations as being hot-headed, arrogant, or otherwise inclined to seize control.<br><br>Another departure from the norm comes in the official documentation of the Reeve’s design, as Karimi, Roux, & Fabjani include very little history of the frame’s development in their documentation. This has led to no small amount of speculation as to the reasoning for the decision, which is only exacerbated by small oddities in the frame’s codebase, which has given rise to a small, dedicated community of individuals poring through every update of the frame’s license for the next piece of the supposed puzzle.",
