    "description": "Founded by three spacers who grew tired of the waste inherent in interstellar shipping, Karimi, Roux, and Fabjani Wholesalers began life as a company that would bid on or retrieve shipments that had been written off by their corporate owners, inventory and repair the contents, and resell them to the populace out in the Rim at an affordable price. Though unpopular with larger corporations, the company operated entirely within the law, supplying bulk goods to those who would otherwise be unable to afford them.<br><br>Due to slim profit margins, the company grew slowly. Dangerous work combined with low prices kept costs high, and limited the scope of what the company could achieve, until fortune intervened. A routine auction of lost goods yielded the ultimate prize for the still small crew: a container of experimental, currently-unprintable Coldcore reactors, destined for a future in cutting edge machinery somewhere out in the black, now under the auspices of barely a dozen employees.<br><br>Putting together collective experiences and some outside contract help, Karimi, Roux, and Fabjani developed a line of mechanized chassis using these reactors, designed to solve problems faced out on the frontier, by people who lived there. With their initial line now out in the world, the company is looking to expand its market share.",
