    "description": "The Charioteer is perhaps one of Chandrasekhar & Herschel's most immediately recognizable chassis despite its diminutive size, and it features prominently in much of the company's marketing material. This fast and lightweight model has its origins in the popular sport of performance chassis racing, where speed, handling, and agility are typically valued more highly than firepower. As a result the chassis itself is minimally armed and armored, boasting a streamlined frame constructed from advanced materials along with a powerful, compact reactor and drive systems capable of outputting extreme overland kp/h speeds for extended durations, though maintenance times between sorties are commensurately high as well.<br>Nonetheless the Charioteer is guaranteed by C&H to perform to mil-spec standard, intended to fill the role of a high-speed reconnaissance and forward observation unit, and its ability to cover long distances rapidly has also seen it employed for other tasks such as search-and-rescue operations and courier duties. Due to the frame's compact design, larger pilots may find this chassis less comfortable to operate for extended deployments.",

Disengaging a reactor's fusion regulators is highly inadvisable for anyone who is not a certified nuclear reactor technician, and C&H Ltd. waives all responsibility for pilots who opt to do so anyway.

Chassis-grade weaponry is notoriously resistant to conventional sound suppression techniques, and advanced sensor systems are highly capable of triangulating incoming weapons fire via accoustics, thermal signatures, and electromagnetic discharge.<br> The eventual solution was a surprisingly archaic one, but one that nonetheless has amply proven its effectiveness in combat. The Blackjacket is a chassis-grade compound bow capable of (relatively) silently launching large, reinforced arrows at velocity sufficient to threaten even armored cavalry. The required draw weight in order to achieve this output necessitates the use of advanced engineering materials such as nanocarbon fiber and arachnosynth weave in order to withstand the stresses of purely mechanical operation at chassis scale without immediately shattering. Even then the bow also employs a rudimentary electromagnetic launch-assist system along with additional torque enhancers, though overall projectile velocity remains comparatively low next to more conventional armaments. As such, effect on target is regularly facilitated through the use of specialized warheads in order to defeat more advanced defensive measures, with the standard loadout utilizing a contact-triggered piston spike designed to penetrate armor.",

  "description": "Harrison Armory's latest public beta test license is now available for qualified pilots interested in participating in live testing of their newest in-development armaments. Developed under the codename Downwell, this license represents the Think Tank's ongoing efforts at creating a comprehensive full-frame gravitic platform. Artificial gravity generation currently remains limited in practical civilian applications but finds increasing use in military theaters, primarily in nearlight k-comp systems. Finding viable ways to expand upon the uses of this technology is the next obvious step, and HA is uniquely poised to deliver on that promise thanks to decades of experience in cutting-edge and paracausal combat systems development.",
