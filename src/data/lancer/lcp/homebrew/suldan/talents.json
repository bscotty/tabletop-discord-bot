It always had been, but many forgot this truth as warfare evolved, bringing with it guns, artillery, orbital bombardment, so many impersonal and inelegant ways to kill, a trillion canvases squandered in the mud.

In the arena or on the battlefield you proudly display that skill for all to witness accompanied by the war drum beat of steel against steel, each victory claimed with style and grace, every killing blow an expressive statement.",
