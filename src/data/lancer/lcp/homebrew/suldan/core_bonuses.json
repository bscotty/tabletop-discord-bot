        "description": "In the event of high-speed crashes and other similar catastrophic impact events the window for effective pilot recovery shortens drastically in the event of a cockpit fire. C&H's racing derived all-chassis template utilizes a dedicated chemical minifac to automatically produce a variety of fast-acting, stably inert flame suppressants and other neutralizing agents as circumstances dictate."

        "description": "Through a comprehensive full-frame upgrade consisting of strategically engineered pre-weakened casings printed around potentially volatile systems such as internal munitions storage or power relays, catastrophic damage can be mitigated by channeling secondary detonations and pressure waves away from vital structural components in a controlled, predetermined fashion."

        "description": "Enhanced physical protection can be achieved through an integrated series of framemounted struts, crash bars, reinforced actuators, and cockpit roll cages. While such measures are typically employed by racers or arena fighters to reduce the likelihood of collission trauma, they also benefit combat pilots operating in high-threat conditions or during air-drop/orbital insertion maneuvers."

        "description": "Most military-grade coldcore reactors impose automatic safety cutoffs during forced venting procedures in order to avoid cascading stresses, but by skillfully (if perhaps incautiously) overriding these cutoffs, brief moments of hyperspec action can be achieved without sacrificing additional stability by rerouting power feeds directly into a frame's primary drive systems along with a series of integrated emergency-use jump jets."

Additionally, 1/scene, whenever you overcharge to take an additional quick action you may add +2 Accuracy to any one roll that action requires. If that roll is an attack, its damage cannot be reduced in any way. Afterwards, whether this action succeeds or fails, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 or 2 you take 5 AP pilot damage and become Impaired and Slowed until the end of your next turn. If this reduces you to 0 HP or less you go down and out.",
        "description": "An extremely risky modification proscribed by formal military regulations in many nations and corpro-states, overclocking a mech's neural interface systems can give pilots a valuable edge when they need it most, but at a dangerous cost. Overuse of such modifications can result in ruptured blood vessels, partial or total limb paralysis, neurological damage, and even death."

Doing this resets your Overcharge counter, destroys your original mech if it was not destroyed already, and your original mech can no longer be repaired or otherwise revived for the remainder of the mission; if your mech is undergoing a reactor meltdown (such as from damage or Self-Destructing) it continues to do so and is then destroyed. This mech shares all your mech skill bonuses, Grit, talents (including weapons and systems granted by talents), and core bonuses as normal. It has its own Core System, enters play with 1 Core Power, and you may allocate its own weapons and systems however you like independently of your original mech during Full Repairs.",
