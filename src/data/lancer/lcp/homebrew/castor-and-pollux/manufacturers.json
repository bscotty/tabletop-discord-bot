    "description": "Pinnacle Industries is well known in the fields of terraforming and colonial development, with products ranging from building materials to seed banks to agricultural equipment. Their first foray into mech design was intended for this same purpose, building frames that could carve out forests and mountains, shaping the land for new settlement. <br><br>Colonies can be ripe targets for piracy however, and it became increasingly clear that they needed new methods of self-defense, without relying on expensive or unreliable third parties. The development of their Non-Civilian Hardware branch signaled a new era for Pinnacle, with a sudden and unexpected increase in profits as they broke into a new market: warfare.<br><br> The rampant growth of this new branch led to several disparate development branches from troop munitions to vehicles and ship design. The Orion Faction development shell was tasked specifically with updating their existing civilian mech designs to combat ready models, a task they’ve taken to with extreme zeal.<br><br>PI-OF FRAMES are a mix of simple, sturdy designs that reflect their blue-collar background, and more experimental military hardware developed de novo by the Orion Faction. Licensing contracts are all managed through Pinnacle Industries’ main branch, with most of their sales coming from colonial administrators and regional governments looking to protect their assets from instability and assault.",
