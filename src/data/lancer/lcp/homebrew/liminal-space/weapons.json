This is because the core of this weapon system is a Núada-Class NHP, controlling the complex systems behind this unusual sword. Rainbow light glints off the true form of the blade when it moves, a thin slice of blinkspace itself as it cuts through reality around it. With invocations of liturgicode Núada can be awakened to full consciousness for a moment and this blade will cleave a chasm through the fabric of existence.<br><br>Núada sleeps uneasily. One of the original NHPs designed to travel through blinkspace; it lost its mind to the impossibilities of that realm. The maimed god is still in shock, responding like a sleepwalker to orders and questions. Despite that, its insights are hard to overstate as the NHP forms impossible links and gives half-formed prophecy to its Lancer. Occasionally it turns and tosses, nightmares crossing its mind. Pilots are recommended to cycle Núada-class NHPs before long as the nightmares become increasingly common. Do not let it remember."

Pilots caught in the crossfire describe it as like getting run over by a burning car, and that’s <i>before</i> they realize the spike stuck in them is still cooking their rig."
