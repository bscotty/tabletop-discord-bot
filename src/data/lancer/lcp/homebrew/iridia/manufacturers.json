    "description": "Iridia was a peaceful planet, watched over by their deity... but it was not to last. Demons descended from the stars to cast down the goddess, claiming that she was a tyrant, and enthrone their own 'Union' in her place. <br><br>To protect her people, the goddess stole technologies from the invaders, and she iterated on them with her magic. In the end, though, it was not enough. Even the sacrifice of Iridian innocence was not enough to save them. <br><br>While the truth was more complex than that, this was the view that most Iridians held. Lost without their goddess, they had to begrudgingly accept Union onto their planet as they found their own way. <br><br>But, while there was peace, there was not exactly trust. The Demonworks was forged to ensure that Iridia could always protect herself. The goddess' designs still functioned, and she had also left behind scattered blueprints that she'd not yet fully fleshed out. The engineers of the Demonworks may not exactly understand the divine workings, but they continue her legacy to this day. And so Iridia and her people are protected. <br><br>But, not just Iridia. Demonworks frames have begun slowly tricking their way out into space, chiefly into the hands of others who wish to protect their own homes. Iridia may have been forever scarred by the war, but they will try their hardest to ensure that doesn't happen to anyone else.",
