    "description": "Harrison Armory's primary model Legionnaire heavy battle rifle is a mainstay of both regular and auxiliary Armory forces regardless of theater or world of origin, standardizing logistics and streamlining integration of foreign and local assets. Chambered in a high-caliber round with a variety of magazine options, the weapon is both inexpensive to print and easy to operate despite its size, and the integrated grenade launcher gives each operator enhanced breach and counter-defilade capabilities as needed, regardless of specialty.",
