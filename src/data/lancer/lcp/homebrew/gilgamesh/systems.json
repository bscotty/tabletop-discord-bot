    "description": "Mass produced and distributed to Armory Legions wherever they may find themselves deployed, the \"Argonaut\" multipurpose utility drone is a common sight throughout the Purview and beyond. Each Argonaut is a highly flexible, modular drone platform which is rapidly assembled prior to deployment from a variety of prefabricated systems and components, including threat interception arrays, electrostatic discharge area denial/suppression projectors, and even high explosive payloads. Legionnaire doctrine calls for extensive use of Argonaut drones to supplement and enhance unit longevity in the field whenever possible, and attrition rates among Legionnaires involved in active combat tend to be correspondingly high, necessitating frequent reprint and resupply.",

    "description": "Emergency repair modules are often a mainstay on Armory chassis galaxy-wide. Through a combination of active nanite slurry, hardpatch welding, and shunting to redundant systems in response to immediate damage, they ensure that a chassis will be able to quickly complete nonmassive battlefield repairs in order to remain active without compromising operational effectiveness or pilot safety. A number of informal celebratory traditions have arisen throughout the Legions to commemorate a pilot's first time taking damage sufficient to trigger an ERM in combat.",
