    "description": "<p>In the ancient days of mankind, fire was all that separated men from beasts. They delighted in it, nourished it, bowed before it as a god, and they used it to conquer the Cradle until all was ash. Never forget that the wildfire burns indiscriminately. The volcano ruptures the homes of good and evil alike. And from the fleeting cinders on solar winds, the dead’s stories fade to silence, bones lost to ash. To wield fire now is to recognize that the flame is not what separated mankind from the wolves and lions they once feared. Only the truly reckless and foolhardy would believe they can control the flames long enough to protect not only themselves but others before everything is reduced to dying embers and soot on the soldiers’ feet. Fire does not make men of beasts; it makes beasts of men.</p>",
