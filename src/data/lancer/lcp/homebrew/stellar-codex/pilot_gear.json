    "description": "When activated, the Chronoscope allows the user to choose up to 10 contiguous minutes from the preceding 24 hours. The user, and anyone else that remains within 5m of the Chronoscope, are able to see their current position as if during that timespan, which elapses in realtime and cannot be paused. Only visuals can be experienced through the Chronoscope, not any other senses, though the user is able to walk around with the device to change their perspective on events. Recording devices are unable to perceive the Chronoscope’s effects, forcing any documentation to be made manually.",

    "description": "When placed against an unattended object and activated, a grav-handle attaches to it and negates most of its weight, making it trivial to move around. The device is able to be freely turned off and detached - though a safety measure prevents this while an object is not resting on a surface. The consumer model is able to affect items up to a maximum size of 40 cubic meters, with its battery life allowing approximately 15 minutes of use before it needs to be recharged.",

Electronics are unfortunately beyond the ability of the toolbox to create. Tools are able to be returned to the box after use to replenish the mass - and rumour speaks of greywash versions that are able to replicate additional nanites from other objects placed in the box.",

As a side effect, the contents tend to survive anything that manages to destroy the stasis chamber - even in cases where it’s been effectively blown to pieces.",

It’s even able to split into multiple articles of clothing or reintegrate into one larger piece such as a dress. Adding a new wardrobe item can be done quickly via scan, or manually edited over the course of several  minutes (or, for true perfectionists, hours) on a linked device.",

Tangle vines are hardy, durable, and are able to easily clog up a corridor or choke an inactive mech or shuttle during the 10 minutes of rapid growth. Without fire, it can take hours to clear - though the vines do avoid intense heat sources like an active reactor, rendering them ineffective in combat situations. If not destroyed, the vines wither away to dust after 24 hours.",

Nobody’s quite sure why they do this (or how), though the leading theory is it’s a natural defense against predators. They’re slow to bond with people, but are steadfast companions once they’ve chosen someone.",

Juveniles are easily tempted to create ‘nests’ of shiny things in ships or stations, and - while mischievous - are excellent at keeping pests at bay.
