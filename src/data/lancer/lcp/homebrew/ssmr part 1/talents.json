So let fools be fools, and speak your truth. Tell them the gods they worship die a quiet death; tell them the manna they covet invites despondency; and the voices they follow lead nowhere. They will hear you, this is undeniable, and in doing so will even begin to question the motives of the hands they use to hold and the feet they use to walk. Your power is that of the Orator, and in years to come your histories will paint war a bygone remembrance.",
