Your next turn must be slow and repeat this delay effect. Each time you do this, increase he width of the line by 1 space on either side (so 1>3>5), and its length by 3 spaces. You cannot attack while holding Divine Delay. Legend characters always take 25% of max hp from this ability instead of other effects.",
