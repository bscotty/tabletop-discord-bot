From town to town they act as errant knights and mercenaries, protecting the weak and vulnerable, and driving back the Blights with hammer-like blows from their greatshields, which they throw like a discus with incredible force. The imperious and mighty presence of a Bastion in town is a stabilizing force and can become an event for a whole village. All Bastions follow an ancient and long-forgotten hero’s code, an old oath to stand against chaos in all its forms.",
